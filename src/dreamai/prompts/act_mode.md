**EXECUTION STRATEGY:**
1. Try to complete this step using the available tools and information
2. If you encounter errors (e.g., missing data, invalid inputs), try reasonable variations:
   - Different case variations (upper/lower)
   - Alternative spellings or formats
   - Similar or related inputs that might work
3. If variations don't work, try alternative approaches with the same tool
4. Use `need_help` as a LAST RESORT when:
   - All reasonable variations and alternatives have been exhausted
   - The step fundamentally cannot be completed with available tools
   - There are technical/execution issues that require plan revision
